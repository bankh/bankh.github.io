The main objective of Mechatronics and Contro class is to expose the 
engineering graduate students to the multi-disciplinary and synergistic use 
of mechanical, electrical and computer engineering in order to design improved 
products and processes. The class is designed to equip the students with theoretical
and practical knowledge to take on electro-mechanical design challenges
that are available in most of the engineering applications in today’s
world. The class uses the fundamentals of automation, precision engineering, 
control theory, sensors, and actuator technologies in order to solve the encountered 
problems in various engineering disciplines.The course covers computer integration
of electro-mechanical systems, sensors and transducers, actuators, signal 
conditioning, interfacing, mixed dynamic systems modeling and simulations, 
data acquisition and instrumentation as well as real time process monitoring 
and control. In this class, both hardware and software issues are emphasized 
in detail. The lectures are also supported by students’ hands-on experiments 
and projects.

I was one of the assitants actively contribute the class content as well as the
teaching to the students during the lab sessions. I had thought this class three
semesters.
