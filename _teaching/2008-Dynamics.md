Dynamics is a fundemental course in Mechanical Engineering education and 
it is targeting all mechanical engineering students at Koc Univeristy. It
focuses on teaching the concepts and methods on planar and three-dimensional 
kinematics and kinetics of particles and rigid bodies. It covers work, energy, 
impulse and momentum concepts

I was one of the assitants actively contribute the class content as well as the
teaching to the students during the lab sessions. I had thought this class two
semesters.
