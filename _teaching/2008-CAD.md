This course aims at preparing the engineering student to future courses 
where Computer Aided Design (CAD) is used as a tool to accomplish a given task. 
For this reason, students are required to learn CAD software such that they can 
create and design mechanical parts, products and assemblies. The CAD/CAM software 
utilized in this course is SIEMENS NX which has been highly used in various industries 
all around the world in the design and manufacturing of parts and products.

I was one of the assitants actively contribute the class content as well as the
teaching to the students during the lab sessions. I had thought this class three
semesters.
