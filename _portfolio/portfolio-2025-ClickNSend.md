## Project Overview

ClickNSend is a Fusion 360 Add-In that streamlines the 3D printing workflow by addressing a key limitation in Fusion 360's standard print utility. The standard print utility lacks efficient functionality for exporting multiple selected bodies directly to third-party slicers, creating friction in the design-to-print workflow.

## What It Does

ClickNSend sends selected bodies or components from Fusion 360 directly to your preferred slicer software (default: Orca Slicer) with a single click, eliminating manual export and import processes.

## Key Features

- **One-click export** to your slicer (while using the default settings)
- **Multi-selection support** for multiple bodies or components
- **Integration with Fusion 360's interface** for seamless workflow
- **Open-source and modifiable** for community contributions
- **Built with Python** using the Fusion 360 API

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python
- **Platform**: Fusion 360 Add-In
- **API**: Fusion 360 API
- **License**: Open Source

## Repository and Resources

- **Repository**: [GitHub - ClickNSend](https://github.com/bankh/ClickNSend)
- **Problem Discussion**: [LinkedIn Post](https://lnkd.in/gEn7JkXx) (see comments for other proposed solutions)

## Impact

This project demonstrates the value of identifying workflow inefficiencies in professional software and creating targeted solutions. As a Saturday morning project, it showcases rapid prototyping and problem-solving skills while contributing to the 3D printing community.

The code is available for anyone who might find it useful or want to contribute improvements.
