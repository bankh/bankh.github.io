While working on an AI-based solution for a PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) process, I identified significant friction in navigating Fusion 360's API documentation. The existing workflow required excessive time and cognitive effort to understand relationships between API objects, often necessitating navigation between multiple pages without losing context.

## Problem Statement

The current Fusion 360 API documentation design creates barriers to comprehensive understanding:
- High cognitive load to memorize object relationships
- Fragmented navigation between multiple documentation pages  
- Lack of integrated view combining high-level and detailed information
- Missing direct links between Fusion's object map PDF and official documentation

## Solution

I developed an enhanced interactive webpage that builds upon Fusion's existing API object map by providing:

- **Integrated Documentation Links**: Direct connections to official Autodesk documentation
- **Code Repository Access**: Links to Adsk Python codebase and samples
- **High-Level Overview**: Methods, properties, and object relationships in one view
- **Search Functionality**: Active search capability for rapid navigation
- **Contextual Navigation**: Maintains context while exploring API relationships

## Technical Implementation

The solution leverages Fusion 360's existing API object map as a foundation while adding interactive enhancements that bridge the gap between high-level architecture understanding and detailed implementation guidance.

## Impact

This tool supports current and future development efforts by reducing documentation friction and enabling developers to maintain focus on problem-solving rather than navigation. The project is open for community contributions and feature requests.
