```yaml
video_show: true       # Shows video thumbnail
slides: "/files/..."   # Shows slides icon (since slide_show not true)
github: "https://..."  # Shows GitHub icon
```

### 2. All Icon Links
```yaml
video_show: false      # Shows video icon
slide_show: false      # Shows slides icon  
github: "https://..."  # Shows GitHub icon
```

### 3. Publication References
```yaml
publication: "2024-ACM-CatalogBank"  # Single publication
# OR
publication: "2024-Paper-One, 2023-Paper-Two"  # Multiple publications
```

### 4. Research Areas Integration
```yaml
selected: true
keyword: "Computer Vision, Machine Learning"  # "Computer Vision" becomes research area
```

The template will automatically:
- Show poster image as main thumbnail
- Display video/slides as thumbnails OR icons based on _show flags
- Create clickable icon links for GitHub, publications, etc.
- Integrate selected items into research areas based on first keyword
