title: "SimpleFOC: Field Oriented Control Library"
excerpt: "We present SimpleFOC, a C++ library implementing Field‑Oriented Control (FOC) for brushless DC (BLDC) and stepper motors, aiming to be both generic and cross‑platform. FOC is highly efficient for controlling electrically commutated motors but demands complex computations. Most existing implementations are tightly coupled to specific microcontrollers or hardware stacks. SimpleFOC fills that gap by offering a flexible, modular, platform‑agnostic approach."
