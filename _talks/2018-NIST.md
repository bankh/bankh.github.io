Monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics (MDP) play important role in manufacturing industry. Predictive
algorithms indicate potential problems of a machine-tool, process, or raw materials involved in the operation
of the system of interest. On the other hand, MDP algorithms have to be supported by visualization
interfaces to facilitate the interaction between the user or other decision maker and the monitored 
system. These interfaces have been evolving from simple light or sound indicators to digital representations
-Digital Twin- of the system in mixed reality systems (e.g. Holo Computers). One example of such an interfacescomes
from space missions: the crew of the International Space Station (ISS) must follow thousands of standard operating
procedures with the tools in the station. Performing these procedures in time sensitive manner.
