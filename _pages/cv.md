Education
======
* M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering, Rutgers University, 2015
* M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering, Koc University, 2011
* B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering with System Dynamics and Control Track, Istanbul Technical University, 2010
* B.Sc. in Textile Engineering, Istanbul Technical University, 2008

Work experience
======
<b> Feb 2014 - Present: Project Lead and Research Scientist at Siemens Corporation Corporate Technology, Automation Runtime Technologies <b />
* Develop interdisciplinary line of research in engineering and science which would be translated into products and/or prototypes for clients
* Recognize the gaps in the Siemens' technology products and create innovative ideas for having direct impact related with Business Units
* Collaborate with other groups and research group members
* Define and lead research projects, which may include technical supervision for software engineers, engineers, and interns
* Setup, manage, and run the research group’s lab or specific projects (e.g. FoodLab with innovative projects AgPods, RoboticsLab with an AI imbued Gantry Robot)
* Generate high-quality invention disclosures and patent applications
* Publish research results in top journals and conferences

<b> Sept 2013 - Feb 2014: Research Intern at Siemens Corporation Corporate Technology Product Simulation and Modeling <b />
* Worked on the programming for the additive manufacturing add-on -Siemens NX package- in order to generate mechanical support structures
* Proposed ideas and actively aided for the preparations of client’s proposals
* Received a grant for an internal seed-funding competition “Siemens Agile Manufacturing System” -mobile digital manufacturing platform which utilized a digital manufacturing stack in Robot Operating System [ROS]; designed and fabricated the validation platforms - SpiderBots. The stack includes path planning for digital manufacturing; perception, navigation, and odometry packages for the robot.
* Participated Hackathons which we developed a web interface –named as Spark (Internal Kickstarter Platform) in 2013; Siemens Virtual Office (Android-based and
immersive VR experience for Siemens PLM Software) in 2014; and pack3D (3D nesting algorithm for additive manufacturing) in 2015.
