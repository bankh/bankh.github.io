About me
------
I am the Founder and President of Craftnetics, Inc. and a former Assistant Professor at California State University, Chico, in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Mechatronic Engineering, and Advanced Manufacturing. Before joining Chico State, I was a Project Lead and Research Scientist at Siemens Corporation Corporate Technology. At SCCT, I worked on artificial intelligence and robotics in various research groups, contributing to projects such as the Support Generation of Additive Manufacturing Package for Siemens NX and the Resilient Control of Distributed Ship Control Systems. I have also innovated and realized the [Siemens Agile Manufacturing System](https://goo.gl/dPYpWo) and, more recently, the [Autonomous Gantry Robot System](https://bankh.github.io/files/SME_NAMRC_46_Paper_140.pdf) and the [Autonomous Agricultural Production System](https://goo.gl/FdmDLS). Additionally, I led a team of scientists to secure government grants, serving as PI and Co-PI for several of those projects.

During my graduate studies at Rutgers University, Koc University, and Colorado State University, I conducted research on  flexible electronics, soft robotics, micro-manufacturing, generative design and engineering of cyber-physical systems, and signal processing and prognostics for advanced manufacturing. 

My current research interests and work focus on autonomy, robotics, and artificial intelligence and their applications in several domains (e.g., advanced manufacturing, agriculture, etc.). My portfolio provides more details on my past and recent projects.
