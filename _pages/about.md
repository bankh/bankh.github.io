I am a research scientist at Siemens Corporation Corporate Technology. Before SCCT, I was a research
assistant in Rutgers University, University of Connecticut, and Carnegie Mellon University where I 
was conducting research on flexible electonics, soft robotics, signal processing and prognostics 
for advanced manufacturing, and micro manufacturing, respectively.  

In SCCT, I've worked in different technology fields and research groups where I've been part of projects
such as Support Generation of Additive Manufacturing Package for Siemens NX; Resilient Control of Distributed
Ship Control Systems; [Siemens Agile Manufacturing System](https://goo.gl/dPYpWo); and recently Autonomous Gantry 
Robot System as well as [Autonomous Agricultural Pod System](https://goo.gl/VBnZ3c).

My current research interest and work based on autonomy, robotics, and its applications for industrial
domain. Please see portfolio for more details of the past and recent projects.
