I was a project lead and research scientist at Siemens Corporation Corporate Technology. Before SCCT, I was a research
assistant in Rutgers University and Carnegie Mellon University where I 
was conducting research on flexible electronics, soft robotics, signal processing and prognostics 
for advanced manufacturing, and micro manufacturing, respectively.  

In SCCT, I worked in different technology fields and research groups where I've been part of projects
such as Support Generation of Additive Manufacturing Package for Siemens NX; Resilient Control of Distributed
Ship Control Systems. I innovate and realize [Siemens Agile Manufacturing System](https://goo.gl/dPYpWo); and 
recently Autonomous Gantry Robot System as well as [Autonomous Agricultural Pods](https://goo.gl/FdmDLS) which 
I led a team of people to realize the idea. I was also PI and Co-PI for a few different government projects.

My current research interest and work are based on autonomy, robotics, and its applications for industrial
domain. Please see portfolio for more details of the past and recent projects.
