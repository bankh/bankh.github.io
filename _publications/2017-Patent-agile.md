## üìå Overview

This patent application, published on **March 7, 2019**, describes an **agile manufacturing platform and system** that enables flexible, mobile manufacturing operations through collaborative robotic platforms. The system comprises mobile manufacturing robots with articulated arms, machine tools, and cloud-connected task management capabilities for distributed manufacturing operations ([Google Patents][1]).

---

## Why It Matters

Traditional manufacturing systems are often fixed in location and lack flexibility for dynamic production needs. This patent addresses the need for agile, mobile manufacturing solutions that can adapt to changing production requirements, enable on-site manufacturing, and provide scalable distributed manufacturing capabilities without the constraints of static installations.

---

## Core Innovations

1. **Mobile manufacturing platform**
   Planar mobile base with articulated legs or wheels, supporting a robotic arm with at least three degrees of freedom and integrated machine tools for on-site manufacturing tasks ([Google Patents][1]).

2. **Hybrid mobility system**
   Combines legs and wheels for versatile terrain traversal, with optional suspension and rollers on legs for enhanced mobility across various surfaces ([Google Patents][1]).

3. **Integrated manufacturing capabilities**
   Robotic arm carries specialized tools such as additive manufacturing extruders, welding torches, or other machine tools for diverse manufacturing operations ([Google Patents][1]).

4. **Cloud-connected collaborative operation**
   Each platform communicates with a distributed database, receiving CAD/CAM/CAX tasks and transmitting real-time status updates for coordinated manufacturing operations ([Google Patents][1]).

5. **Dynamic task redistribution**
   Automatic task reassignment when platforms go offline, ensuring continuous manufacturing operations and improved system resilience ([Google Patents][1]).
