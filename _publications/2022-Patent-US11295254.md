## üìå Overview

This patent, issued on **April 5, 2022**, describes a **flexible product manufacturing planning system** that employs receding-horizon optimization to adapt dynamically to changing production needs. The system utilizes a planning engine that receives input data on manufacturing parameters and solves optimization problems with respect to cost functions to generate **receding horizon execution plans** for manufacturing operations ([USPTO][1]).

---

## Why It Matters

Traditional manufacturing systems struggle with adaptability when production disturbances occur, often requiring static plans or manual interventions. This patent addresses the need for **flexible and responsive manufacturing systems** that can handle variable production environments with multiple products while maintaining efficiency and minimizing costs.

---

## Core Innovations

1. **Receding Horizon Planning Engine**
   
   Receives input data on manufacturing parameters and continuously solves optimization problems to generate execution plans that adapt to changing conditions ([USPTO][1]).

2. **Dynamic Re-optimization**
   
   Upon completion of execution subsets or trigger events, the system re-solves the optimization problem to obtain new receding horizon execution plans for subsequent manufacturing steps ([USPTO][1]).

3. **Cost Function Optimization**
   
   The system minimizes cost functions while planning manufacturing steps, enabling efficient resource allocation and production scheduling ([USPTO][1]).

4. **Iterative Plan Updates**
   
   Continuously integrates new input data and system feedback to refine and improve execution plans in real-time ([USPTO][1]).

---

## Core Value

This invention enables **adaptive manufacturing systems** that can respond dynamically to production disturbances, demand changes, and resource constraints. It reduces the need for manual planning interventions while supporting real-time integration with manufacturing execution systems, making it particularly valuable for environments with high variability and diverse product portfolios.

---

## Benefits & Applications

* **Enhanced Flexibility**: Enables manufacturing systems to adapt quickly to changing production requirements and disturbances.
* **Reduced Manual Intervention**: Minimizes the need for human operators to manually adjust production plans when disruptions occur.
* **Optimized Resource Utilization**: Cost function optimization ensures efficient allocation of manufacturing resources and capacity.
* **Real-time Responsiveness**: Supports integration with manufacturing execution systems for immediate plan adjustments based on current conditions.
