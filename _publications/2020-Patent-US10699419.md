## 🧠 US 10699419 B2 — Tracking and Traceability of Parts of a Product (Issued Jun 30 2020)

### 🧾 Overview

This patent proposes systems and techniques for **tracking and tracing components** through manufacturing. It uses an imaging sensor system to capture semantic data describing each step of a manufacturing process and applies **artificial reasoning** to generate assertions characterizing the execution. The data and assertions form a **digital trace record** for each component.

### ⚙️ Key Innovations

* **Semantic data streams**: Cameras and sensors record processes, generating rich data about operations.
* **Artificial reasoning**: The system infers events and generates assertions to describe the manufacturing execution.
* **Digital trace records**: Aggregated data can track parts back to specific events without physical tags or barcodes.

### 📊 Significance

Traditional traceability relies on barcodes, tags, or manual records. This solution reduces labor, eliminates intrusive labeling, and can improve quality control and recall management by **automating traceability**. It also provides a more detailed and reliable record of manufacturing events.
