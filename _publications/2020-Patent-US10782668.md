## üìå Overview

This patent, issued on **September 22, 2020**, describes a method for **developing control applications** for automation systems using an **augmented reality (AR) environment**. A controller receives sensor signals from a real component and simulates a **digital twin** of another component; virtual data from this simulation helps determine parameters for the control application.

---

## Why It Matters

Traditional control application development requires all physical components to be present, leading to delays and increased costs during commissioning phases. This patent addresses the need for **early-stage control development** that enables engineers to work with partial hardware setups while maintaining system integrity and functionality.

---

## Core Innovations

* **Digital twin simulation**: A virtual component represents a physical component not present in the work environment, enabling partial system testing.
* **AR‚Äëdriven development**: Control engineers view and edit programs via an AR interface, integrating real sensor inputs with virtual data seamlessly.
* **Control application module**: Uses sensor signals and virtual data to determine control parameters in real-time during development phases.

---

## Core Value

This invention enables **early control development** by allowing engineers to develop and test control applications before hardware is fully available. It reduces commissioning downtime, development costs, and system complexity while supporting incremental deployment of automation installations.

---

## Benefits & Applications

* **Accelerated development**: Enables control programming before all physical components are available or installed.
* **Reduced commissioning time**: Early testing and validation reduce errors and debugging time during system deployment.
* **Cost optimization**: Minimizes hardware dependencies during development phases, reducing project costs.
* **Incremental deployment**: Supports phased commissioning approaches with mixed real and virtual components.
