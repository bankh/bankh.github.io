An agile manufacturing platform for manufacture of an object includes a substantially planar body (301) supporting a computer processor (303) and a plurality of articulated legs (305). An articulated robotic arm (307) is rotatably mounted to the planar body and includes at least one articulated joint to providing at least 3 degrees of freedom relative to the planar body. A machine tool (315) is coupled to the articulated robotic arm.
