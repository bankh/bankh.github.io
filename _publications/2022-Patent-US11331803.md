## üìå Overview

This patent, issued on **May 17, 2022**, covers a **mixed reality (MR) system** for programming robotic devices. A computer‚Äëbased tool selects an object, determines its spatial location (Cartesian and orientation coordinates), and executes tasks on the object via a robotic device. The tasks can be simulated in a mixed reality environment before deployment.

---

## Why It Matters

Traditional robot programming approaches (code‚Äëbased, teaching pendants, vision systems, motion tracking) are expensive, time‚Äëconsuming, and require expert knowledge. This patent addresses the need for **accessible robot programming** that reduces dependence on specialists while improving reusability and scalability of robotic task teaching.

---

## Core Innovations

* **Spatial programming with MR**: The system captures precise spatial coordinates and uses MR to visualize tasks in real-time during programming phases.
* **Simulation of tasks**: Initial parameters and task execution are simulated in a virtual environment before deployment to physical robots.
* **User‚Äëfriendly programming**: Users can teach robots complex skills without deep programming knowledge, relying on intuitive MR interfaces.

---

## Core Value

This invention democratizes robot programming by making it accessible to non-specialists through **mixed reality interfaces**. It enables scalable teaching of skill sets to robotic devices while reducing implementation costs and development time for industrial automation applications.

---

## Benefits & Applications

* **Reduced expertise barrier**: Eliminates need for specialized robot programming knowledge through intuitive MR interfaces.
* **Enhanced reusability**: Programmed tasks can be easily adapted and reused across different robotic systems and scenarios.
* **Cost-effective deployment**: Reduces time and resources needed for robot programming and reconfiguration.
* **Simulation-first approach**: Virtual testing reduces errors and improves safety before physical implementation.
