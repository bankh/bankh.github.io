## üìå Overview

We present **SimpleFOC**, a C++ library implementing **Field‚ÄëOriented Control (FOC)** for brushless DC (BLDC) and stepper motors, aiming to be both **generic** and **cross‚Äëplatform** ([Open Journals][1]).

---

## Why It Matters

FOC is highly efficient for controlling electrically commutated motors but demands complex computations. Most existing implementations are tightly coupled to specific microcontrollers or hardware stacks ([Open Journals][1]). SimpleFOC fills that gap by offering a flexible, modular, platform‚Äëagnostic approach.

---

## Key Features

* **Portable across hardware**: supports Atmega, STM32, ESP32, RP2040, Teensy, Portenta, and platforms like Arduino UNO, Nucleo, etc. ([Open Journals][1]).
* **Logical architecture**: divides the system into modular blocks‚Äîmotor, driver, sensors, microcontroller, UI‚Äîenabling easier swapping and reconfiguration ([Open Journals][1]).
* **C++ object‚Äëoriented design**: encapsulates FOC routines, motion control, hardware interfaces, and configurations with intuitive APIs ([Open Journals][1]).
* **Community‚Äëdriven**: >250 GitHub forks, 600+ members engaged in discussions, and 10,000+ posts in its community platform as of mid‚Äë2022 ([Open Journals][1]).

## Core Value

SimpleFOC aims to **democratize advanced motor control**. It removes hardware vendor lock‚Äëin, facilitating rapid experimentation and teaching in robotics, dynamic control systems, and embedded motion applications.
