## üìå Overview

The patent describes improved **support structures used in additive manufacturing** (e.g. selective laser melting) to ensure the integrity of solid 3D-printed models.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Innovations

* **Optimized support generation** for complex geometries through adaptive strategies.
* **Tailored support placement**, considering part geometry to reduce material use and minimize post‚Äëprocessing.
* Designed for compatibility with metal and polymer 3D printing workflows.

---

## üöÄ Benefits & Applications

* Reduces **material waste** and **print time** by minimizing unnecessary supports.
* Improves **surface quality** and reduces **post-print processing**, making it easier to release the printed part.
* Offers better **thermal and mechanical stability** during layer-by-layer fabrication, leading to higher-quality prints for solid models.
