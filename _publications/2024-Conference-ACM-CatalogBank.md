## ðŸ“Œ Overview

**CatalogBank: A Structured and Interoperable Catalog Dataset with a Semiâ€‘Automatic Annotation Tool (DocumentLabeler) for Engineering System Design** was presented at **DocEng â€™24** (ACM Symposium on Document Engineering) in **August 2024**. Authored by **Hasan Sinanâ€¯Bank** (Craftnetics Inc.) and **Danielâ€¯R. Herber** (Colorado State University)Â ([ResearchGate][1]). It was nominated for Best Paper AwardÂ ([Colorado State University Engineering][2]).

## Objective

This work introduces **CatalogBank**, a dataset designed to connect **textual engineering catalogs** with structured, interoperable metadata. It targets improved automation in engineering workflows and downstream NLP tasks like layout analysis and knowledge extractionÂ ([GitHub][3]).

---

## Core Contributions

### 1. **CatalogBank Dataset**

* A collection of diverse **PDF-based catalogs** from engineering vendors (e.g. Thorlabs, McMasterâ€‘Carr).
* Extracts structured information from catalogs such as product specifications, images, tables, and layout elementsÂ ([GitHub][3], [ResearchGate][1]).
* Facilitates bridging of modalities: text, geometry, images, and graph-format data.

### 2. **DocumentLabeler Tool**

* An openâ€‘source, semiâ€‘automatic annotation tool tailored for engineering documents.
* Speeds annotation by combining automation and human review to generate structured labels from PDF layoutÂ ([GitHub][3]).

### 3. **Interoperability & Standardization**

* Creates unified schema and metadata model to enable consistent extraction and downstream integration.
* Helps overcome challenges posed by nonâ€‘standard PDF catalog formats and manual entry bottlenecks.

---

## Significance & Benefits

* **Enables automation** in engineering design workflows by providing structured, labeled data from catalogs.
* Supports **layout analysis** and **information extraction** in Document Engineering and NLP pipelines.
* Contributes a **robust benchmark dataset** for training and evaluating models on catalog-style documentsÂ ([ResearchGate][1]).
