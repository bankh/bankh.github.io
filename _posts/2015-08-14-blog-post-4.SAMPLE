# SAMPLE TEMPLATE: How to Add a New Blog Post
# ===========================================
# To add a new blog post:
# 1. Copy this file and rename it to YYYY-MM-DD-title-of-post.md (e.g., 2023-01-01-new-year-update.md). The date determines ordering (newest first) and permalink.
# 2. Edit the YAML front matter below with your details.
# 3. Add the main content after the YAML in Markdown.
# 4. Place images in /images/ and files in /files/.
# 5. Optional fields: categories, tags, excerpt (short summary), header (for teaser image).
# 6. Save and rebuild the site to see it listed under Blog Posts (if enabled).
