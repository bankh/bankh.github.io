**Short Description:**  
Hydrobot is an open-source hydroponic farming system that automates the movement and handling of plants using a 3-axis Cartesian robotic gantry. Designed for NFT-based hydroponics, the system autonomously transfers plants from germination through cutting using a pick-and-place end-effector. Built on the FarmBot platform, the project targets low-cost, modular, and intelligent farming automation.
