**Project Name:** Machine Tool for Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing "BuildBot"  
**Semester and Year:** Spring 2019

**Team Members:**
- James Bloesch
- Anthony Condos
- Isaac Leker
- Isaac Pendilla
- William Shelton

**Short Description:**  
BuildBot is a proof-of-concept system that replaces traditional billet manufacturing by integrating wire arc welding with a CoreXY motion platform. The system leverages G-code-based control of a MIG welding source to produce custom-shaped steel blanks, reducing waste and machining costs. Designed to fit within a Haas Mini Mill and remain portable, the device targets small-batch, economically viable metal fabrication for CNC users.
