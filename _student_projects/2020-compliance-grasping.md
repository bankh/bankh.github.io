**Project Name:** Compliant and Intelligent Grasping with Parallel Kinematic Mechanism and its Agricultural Application  
**Semester and Year:** 2021

**Team Members:**
- Maryam Nassar
- Travis Bybee
- Joe Karam
- Roque Martinez

**Short Description:**  
This capstone project presents a system that integrates a compliant end-effector and 3D vision for pick-and-place of agricultural products using the Omron Hornet 565 parallel kinematic robot. The system utilizes OpenCV-based object recognition, ROS-integrated control, and Intel D415 depth sensing to guide accurate placement of produce. Designed for high efficiency with >90% vision accuracy, the project contributes toward the Omron lab's Industry 4.0 factory automation pipeline and highlights future potential for advanced CPS integration.
