**Short Description:**  
This capstone project developed a semi-automated plasma cutting system to trim racing kart wheel flanges with improved safety, accuracy, and efficiency. The design automates rotation and tool positioning using a 2-axis stepper motor system and targets a cycle time under one minute. The machine minimizes operator skill requirements and eliminates physical tool contact via plasma cutting, reducing wear and enhancing reliability.
