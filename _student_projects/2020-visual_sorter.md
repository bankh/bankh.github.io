**Project Name:** Vision Sorting System  
**Semester and Year:** Spring 2021

**Team Members:**
- Allan Del Rosario
- Robert Nickerson
- Tyler Weaver

**Advisor:**
- Assistant Professor Hasan Sinan Bank

**Short Description:**  
The Vision Sorting System is an industrial automation project designed to showcase Beckhoff TwinCAT 3's vision inspection and motion libraries. Built for both real-world part sorting and engineering training, the system uses a rotary base and camera to detect object color and actuate a motorized chute via EtherCAT to sort objects. It integrates GigE vision sensors, TwinCAT 3 runtime environments, and ADS for real-time sorting and expansion to shape or dimension classification.
