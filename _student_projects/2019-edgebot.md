**Project Name:** Automated Robot to Treat Machined Parts’ Sharp Edge(s) – Edge Bot  
**Semester and Year:** Spring 2019

**Team Members:**
- Nick McConnell
- Franz Ferre
- Ryan Perez
- Jake Devericks
- Brian Herrera

**Short Description:**  
Edge Bot is a fully automated robotic system that performs precision deburring on complex part geometries. Featuring a 5-axis motion platform and spindle toolhead, the system uses a Fusion 360 plugin with custom G-code generation to remove burrs that conventional 3-axis machines cannot reach. Designed for mild steel and under a $10,000 budget, the Edge Bot addresses safety, efficiency, and scalability in CNC post-processing.
