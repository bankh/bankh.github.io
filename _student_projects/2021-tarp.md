**Short Description:**  
This capstone project presents a modular and affordable scaled autonomous vehicle platform for AI and control systems research. Built on an OpenRC chassis with a BLDC motor, FOC control, and Nvidia Jetson Nano, the system supports low- and high-level research tasks. It features ROS-based architecture, stereo vision integration, and an easily tunable control framework using SimpleFOC and STM32 microcontrollers.
